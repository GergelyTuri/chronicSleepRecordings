# This repository contains hardware and software requirements for running continuous EEG/EMG recordings in mice.

We are developing a EEG/EMG setup to investigate the sleep profile and seizure
incidence in mice using Pinnacle Technology's [SireniaÂ® software
packages](https://www.pinnaclet.com/sirenia.html).

The mouse EEG/EMG recordings take place inside modified Med Associates
sound-attenuating cubicles that are outfitted with
Faraday-shielding copper mesh and sound-proof acoustic foam panels. The
mice undergoing recordings are individually housed inside custom-cut acrylic cages.
Circadian lighting is achieved using LED & IR lights that are powered via
24-hour programmable outlet timers. Overhead cameras are used to record video of
mouse behavior in tandem with EEG/EMG recordings. EEG/EMG signals are recorded
using Pinnacle's EEG/EMG tethered mouse system and headmounts.
