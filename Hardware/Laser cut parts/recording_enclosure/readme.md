# Recording enclosure files for laser cutting

The design of the enclosure is based on the Peng lab's*. A small modification has been made in the enclusure so there is no gap between the base and the top. At least two 18"x24", 1/8" thick Frosted Satin Ice acrilyc sheet is needed for the top of one enclosure. One sheet from the 1/4" acrylic is enough to make two bottoms.

* *The original Peng lab design allows the user for using the Peng lab's custom made treadmill for sleep deprivation (it has a gap betwen the bottom and the top).
