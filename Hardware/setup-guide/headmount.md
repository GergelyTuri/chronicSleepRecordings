## Connecting the EEG/EMG headmount

This portion of the guide explains how to properly connect the preamplifier to
the EEG/EMG headmount. We are using isoflurane to anesthetize the mice during the
connection of the preamplifier to the headmount.

**Materials**
- [2 EEG/1 EMG Mouse Headmount](https://store.pinnaclet.com/products/8201-2-eeg-1-emg-mouse-headmount?variant=12390701727847)
- 6-pin preamplifier
- Isoflurane and paper towels
- Tupperware container with lid
- Hemostat

**Steps**
1. Apply a small amount of isoflurane to a piece of paper towel
2. Place this paper towel into a tupperware container
3. Transfer a mouse into the tupperware container and secure the lid
    * Wait 1-2 minutes for the isoflurane to take effect
4. Transfer the mouse from the tupperware container to the cage floor of the recording enclosure
5. Carefully insert the 6-pin male connector of the preamplifier into the
   headmount
    * **IMPORTANT**: There are two black squares on one side of the preamplifier and one black
      square on the opposite side. The side with **two** black squares is the
      **posterior**, whereas the side with **one** black square is the **anterior**.
    * Use a hemostat to carefully hold the headmount in place
    * Be very gentle with the mouse while inserting the preamplifier pins to the headmount

6. Carefully place the mouse inside of the recording enclosure
7. Allow sufficient time to pass for the mouse to recover from the anesthesia
   before proceeding with an experiment
