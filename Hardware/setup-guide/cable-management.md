## Cable management

This portion of the guide details the cable management inside of the Med
Associates box, which gives it a professional and aesthetically-pleasing look.

We are using a wiring duct from 80/20 that's designed for 10 series aluminum
framing, but a generic [1" cable raceway](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BX69L3L2) can be used alternatively.

**Materials**
- [10 & 15 Series Wiring Duct](https://8020.net/2899.html)
- [T-nuts](https://8020.net/3313.html) & screws
- Velcro cable ties

**Steps**
1. Roll in at least four T-nuts to the backside of the aluminum frame that is
   closest to the back wall
2. Using screws, fix the wiring duct to the T-nuts
    * It is easier to install the screws by cutting the teeth of the wiring duct that neighbor each T-nut
3. Feed the wires through the wiring duct and out to the cable hole found on the side
   of the Med Associates box
4. Bundle and tie the exposed cables together with a velcro cable tie. Attach the
   velcro to the acoustic foam.
