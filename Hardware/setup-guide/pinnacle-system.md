## Pinnacle System, lighting, & ventilation

This portion of the guide explains how to setup the Pinnacle System, circadian
lighting, and ventilation. This is the key hardware of the EEG/EMG recording setup.

**Before starting**
1. Laser-cut the acrylic parts for the commutators, LED lights, and fan cover using acrylic sheets and the laser-cut files [found here](.././Laser%20cut%20parts/)

### Pinnacle System setup
1. Laser cut the commutator plate mount using clear acrylic (1/8" thick)
2. Fix the commutator(s) to the plate mounts using screws
3. Then, fix these plate mounts to the aluminum framing using T-nuts
4. Install the amplifier-to-commutator extension cables
5. Ensure the commutator is mounted directly overhead the intended spot for the recording enclosure
6. Feed the wires through the cable hole found on the side of the Med Associates box

### Lighting setup 
1. Laser cut the LED light plate mounts using opaque acrylic (1/8" thick)
2. Fix the LED light pucks to the center of the plate mounts using screws
  * Feed the LED light cables through the outer hole of the plate mount
3. Slide the LED lights, now fixed to their mounting plates, between the top of the aluminum framing and the ceiling
4. Feed the wires through the cable hole found on the side of the Med Associates box
5. Replace the manufacturer's LED light dimmer switch with the rotary dimmer switch
6. Place a light meter inside the box, close the doors, and dial the rotary dimmer to the desired LED light intensity
  * Our box's light intensity is set to **90 lux**
  * After determining the desired light intensity, mark a line on the rotary with a permanent marker
7. Connect the LED light power cable directly to a 24-HR programmable outlet timer
  * Program the timer "on" phase to be 12 hours

### Ventilation setup
1. Laser cut the acrylic fan cover parts using opaque acrylic (1/8" thick) 
2. Assemble and glue the fan cover parts with Weld-On #4
  * Allow to air dry overnight
3. Slide the fan cover over the ventilation fan outside of the box
4. Connect the 24V AC-to-DC power supply to the ventilation fan
