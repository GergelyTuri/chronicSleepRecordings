   the ceiling and 5" apart using 1/4" screws and a drill
    * Using a blade, carefully remove four square pieces of acoustic foam from the inside wall of
      the box corresponding to the cross-sectional width of the aluminum railings
    * Drill the screws, starting from the outside surface of the box
2. After installing the railings, roll in T-nuts to the railing's T-slots to
   your liking, which can be used to fix overhead attachments
